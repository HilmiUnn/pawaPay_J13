#**pawaPay Website UI Test Automation**

* I have used Java 13 as a programing language
* I have used Selenide for browser automation
* I have used JUnit 5 framework
* I have wrote tests to automate UI test for "https://www.pawapay.co.uk/"

##**Notes related with project:**
- Almost all Thread.sleep command lines are used to show action, no need to use in real test
- I have tried to use almost all related annotations even if not necesaary
- I have added dependencies and related annotations for parallel execution but I could not run in parallel( most probably my fault)
