#**pawaPay Website UI Test Automation**

* I have used Java 13 as a programing language
* I have used Selenide for browser automation
* I have used JUnit 5 framework
* I have wrote test scenarios to automate UI tests for "https://www.pawapay.co.uk/"

##**Notes Related With Project:**
- Almost all Thread.sleep command lines are used to show action, no need to use in real test
- I have tried to use almost all related annotations even if not necesaary
- I have added dependencies and related annotations for parallel execution but I could not run in parallel( most probably my fault)
- I have created a .csv file and I got tje user informations from this dummy csv file to fill contact form

##**Notes Related With Website:**
- "pawaPay" logo which at the API Docs page does not redirect the user to home page
- "support@pawapay.co.uk" link which located on authentication part of API Docs page, opens **404 Page Not Found** page
